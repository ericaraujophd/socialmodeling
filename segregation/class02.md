## 🖥️ Session B (Visualization)

Discussing the implications of the Schelling model

- Explore tolerance thresholds, group asymmetry, neighborhood sizes.
- Class critique: What’s realistic? What’s missing (e.g., structural constraints)?

(lab-memo-2)=
## 👷🏽‍♀️ **Assignment:** Lab Memo #2

**Due:** 9/25 before class | **Points:** 100 points

**Prompt (1-2 pages):**

1. Take the code for the Schelling model implemented in class in the link above (Lecture 6). Your task is to modify the model in some way and analyze the results. You can choose one of the following options:
   - **Add a reporter:** e.g., track the number of moves, average satisfaction, or segregation index over time.
   - **Change the neighborhood definition:** e.g., use a larger or smaller neighborhood size.
   - **Introduce heterogeneity:** e.g., allow agents to have different tolerance levels or preferences.
   - **Add mobility constraints:** e.g., limit how far agents can move in a single step.
2. Write your Lab Memo. You can [download the template in here.](https://calvincollege-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ea47_calvin_edu/ET85m4EZjGJBgUieIcf-DbwBLsmcQR2NA9Sj765A0VpDRQ?e=ywmLIN)
3. Make sure you add the codes you've changed, as well as interface modifications.
4. Submit your Lab Memo in PDF format through Moodle.
