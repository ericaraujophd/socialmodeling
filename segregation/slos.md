# Module 2: Segregation

Welcome to the Segregation Models module! This section explores computational models of residential segregation, building on Thomas Schelling's groundbreaking work {cite}`schelling1971dynamic` on how individual preferences can lead to collective patterns of segregation. We will generalize the residential model and see ways to apply it to other contexts.

Segregation models help us understand how micro-level individual choices can lead to macro-level social phenomena {cite}`schelling1978micromotives`. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore how even mild preferences for similarity can result in highly segregated neighborhoods, providing insights into urban dynamics and social processes.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks
