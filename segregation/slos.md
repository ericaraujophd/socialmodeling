title: "SLOs | Segregation"
subtitle: Student Learning Objectives for Segregation Models Module
---

---

Welcome to the Segregation Models module! This section explores computational models of residential segregation, building on Thomas Schelling's groundbreaking work {cite}`schelling1971dynamic` on how individual preferences can lead to collective patterns of segregation. We will generalize the residential model and see ways to apply it to other contexts.

Segregation models help us understand how micro-level individual choices can lead to macro-level social phenomena {cite}`schelling1978micromotives`. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore how even mild preferences for similarity can result in highly segregated neighborhoods, providing insights into urban dynamics and social processes.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks

## 👩🏾‍🎓 Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

### Core SLOs

- Increase students’ knowledge of social systems and of human behavior within such systems
- Apply algorithmic, statistical, and/or mathematical methods to solve problems, broadly defined to find the answers to questions in various domains (as appropriate).
- Represent, interpret, and process information in graphical, numeric, and/or symbolic forms.

### Conceptual SLOs

- Explain the difference between individual preferences and collective outcomes
- Analyze how threshold models work in social systems
- Evaluate the relationship between micro-motives and macro-behavior

### Technical SLOs

- Navigate the NetLogo interface and basic programming concepts
- Create simple agent-based models with basic behaviors
- Run simulations and collect data from model outputs
- Interpret basic visualization and data outputs
- Implement Schelling's segregation model in NetLogo
- Modify agent rules and parameters to test different scenarios
- Collect and analyze data from agent-based simulations

### Critical Thinking

- Assess the implications of segregation models for real-world policy
- Compare model predictions with empirical data on residential patterns
- Critique the assumptions and limitations of segregation models

### Communication

- Present findings from simulation experiments clearly
- Discuss ethical implications of segregation research
- Connect model insights to contemporary social issues
