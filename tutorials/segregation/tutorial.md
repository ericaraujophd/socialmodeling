# Segregation Model

This is a two-week module exploring the Schelling Segregation Model, which demonstrates how individual preferences can lead to large-scale patterns of segregation in neighborhoods. We'll use the NetLogo modeling environment to simulate and analyze these dynamics.

The objective of this mini-tutorial is to implement from scratch a simple version of the Schelling Segregation Model in NetLogo, explore its behavior, and understand its implications for social dynamics.

The instructions below will guide you through building the model step-by-step. After completing the tutorial, you should be able to modify and experiment with the model on your own.
