# Contagion Models

In this module, you will implement a contagion model in NetLogo using different frameworks. You will analyze the model's behavior under different parameters (e.g., transmission rate, recovery rate) and write a lab memo summarizing your findings.

This models the spread of diseases, information, or behaviors through a population. The contagion process can be influenced by various factors, including individual characteristics, social networks, and environmental conditions. In our tutorial, I will simplify the model to focus on the basic mechanisms of contagion.
