# NetLogo Tutorial Series

:::{warning}
Netlogo has recently released its 7.0 version. A lot of improvements were done in the interface, making it more user-friendly and accessible for beginners. That means that this tutorial might be outdated regarding some of the screen shots. The updates might take a few weeks.

```{attention} Total time commitment:
Approximately 6 hours across 7 tutorials

Welcome to the NetLogo programming material designed specifically for this class. We assume students may not have any prior programming experience. And that's okay! We will walk through the basics of programming in NetLogo, and also learn in class what it feels like building code for modeling social behavior.

## Course Overview

This course teaches agent-based modeling using NetLogo, a powerful yet accessible programming environment. You'll learn to create computational models that help answer questions about social phenomena.

This guide follows the same structure as the [NetLogo documentation](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/), but it is tailored to our course. It is not a replacement for the official documentation, but rather a complement to it. We own all the credit for this material to Ury Wilensky and the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University {cite}`wilensky1999netlogo`. The official documentation is a great resource, and we encourage you to use it as well.

In this tutorial, we intend to provide the basic concepts and programming skills necessary to start programming in NetLogo. This tutorial is focused on programming. Come back to this part whenever you need to refresh your memory on the basic concepts of programming in NetLogo.

```{note}
**No programming background required!** This course is designed for students who have never programmed before. We start with basic concepts and build gradually.
```

### Learning objectives

By completing this tutorial series, you will be able to:

- Create agent-based models from scratch
- Understand how individual behaviors create collective patterns
- Use computational tools to explore social behavior questions
- Analyze and interpret model results
- Extend existing models for new research questions

### Why NetLogo for social models?

- Visual programming environment reduces intimidation
- Designed specifically for modeling social phenomena
- Large community of non-CS users
- Extensive library of existing models to learn from

### Learning Approach

This course uses a **learning-by-doing** approach:

- Start with exploration and experimentation
- Build understanding through hands-on activities
- Progress from simple concepts to complete models
- Focus on visual and conceptual understanding first

## Getting Started

**Begin with:** [Tutorial 0: NetLogo Introduction & Interface](0_intro.md)

**Prerequisites:** None! Just curiosity about social phenomena and willingness to experiment.

**What you'll need:**

- NetLogo software (free download from netlogo.org)
- Willingness to try things and make mistakes
- Notebook for observations and questions

## Learning Path

```{note}
**Prerequisites:** Complete [Tutorial 0: NetLogo Introduction & Interface](../0_intro.md) before starting these programming tutorials.
```

**Recommended progression:**

1. Start with basic concepts and work through each tutorial sequentially
2. Complete all activities and exercises in each tutorial
3. Build the example models to reinforce learning
4. Use the troubleshooting guide when you encounter problems

**Time commitment:** Plan for approximately 5 hours total to complete all programming tutorials with activities.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

- Review the troubleshooting section in Tutorial 6
- Check that you've completed prerequisites
- Try simplifying your code and building complexity gradually
- Ask questions during class or office hours
