Now, notice that in our model, there are situations where there is no convergence to either all cooperators or all defectors. 

1. Can you explain why this happens?
2. Can you modify the model so that it always converges to either all cooperators or all defectors? (tip: you might need the change the amount of neighbors considered in the evolutionary stage)
3. Can you modify the model so that cooperation is more likely to dominate the population? (tip: you might need to change the payoff structure)
4. Create monitors and plots to track the proportion of cooperators and defectors over time.
