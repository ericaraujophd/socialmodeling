# Social Computing Course Website

Welcome to the **Agent-Based Modeling & Social Theory** course (HNRS-251-A), part of the Honors program at Calvin University. This repository hosts the course website, which serves as the central hub for all course materials, including the syllabus, schedule, and assignments.

## Course Overview

This course explores agent-based modeling (ABM) as a tool for understanding social phenomena. Students will engage in hands-on projects, applying computational methods to analyze and simulate social systems. The course is structured into modules, each focusing on a specific topic, such as segregation, contagion, cooperation, and polarization.
