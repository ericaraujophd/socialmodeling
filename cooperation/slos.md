Welcome to the **Cooperation Models** module! This module explores one of the most fundamental questions in social science: how and why do humans cooperate? We'll use game theory and agent-based modeling to understand the conditions that promote or hinder cooperation in social systems.

Cooperation models help us understand how individuals can work together for mutual benefit, even when short-term self-interest might suggest otherwise. Through computational modeling, we'll explore classic cooperation dilemmas, evolutionary strategies, and the role of reputation, punishment, and reward systems in maintaining cooperative behavior. We'll examine foundational work from Axelrod on the evolution of cooperation, Ostrom's principles for governing commons, and contemporary research on institutional design and collective action.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks

## 👩🏾‍🎓 Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

By the end of this module, students will be able to accomplish the following SLOs:

### Core SLOs

- Develop students' understanding of biblically-guided norms of justice, equality, freedom, and stewardship.
- Increase students' knowledge of social systems and of human behavior within such systems (revisited in the context of cooperation and dilemmas).
- Apply algorithmic, statistical, and/or mathematical methods to solve problems (as applied to cooperation and social dilemmas).

### Conceptual SLOs

- Explain the fundamental cooperation dilemmas (Prisoner's Dilemma, Public Goods, etc.)
- Understand evolutionary approaches to cooperation and reciprocity
- Analyze the role of institutions, norms, and sanctions in promoting cooperation
- Evaluate different mechanisms for solving collective action problems

### Technical SLOs

- Implement game theory models in NetLogo
- Model evolutionary strategies and fitness landscapes
- Simulate reputation systems and social learning mechanisms
- Analyze equilibrium outcomes and stability conditions

### Critical Thinking

- Assess the conditions under which cooperation emerges and persists
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different institutional designs
- Critique the assumptions of rational choice and evolutionary models
- Connect cooperation theory to real-world social and political challenges

### Communication

- Present game theory concepts to diverse audiences
- Discuss the implications of cooperation research for policy design
- Articulate the tension between individual and collective interests
- Engage with debates about human nature and social institutions
