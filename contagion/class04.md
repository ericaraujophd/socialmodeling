(lab-memo-5)=
## 👷🏽‍♀️ **Assignment:** Lab Memo #5

**Due:** 10/28 before class | **Points:** 100 points

**Prompt (1-2 pages):**

Contagion model implementation & analysis

1. Use the model we started in class (SIR) as a base.
2. Analyze the model’s behavior under different parameters (e.g., transmission rate, recovery rate).
3. Build at least two new plots or monitors to track additional metrics (e.g., peak infection time, total recovered).
4. Write your Lab Memo. You can [download the template in here.](https://calvincollege-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ea47_calvin_edu/ET85m4EZjGJBgUieIcf-DbwBLsmcQR2NA9Sj765A0VpDRQ?e=ywmLIN)
5. Make sure you add the codes you’ve changed, as well as interface modifications.
6. Submit your Lab Memo in PDF format through Moodle.
