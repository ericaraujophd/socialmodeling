# SLOs | Contagion

Welcome to the **Contagion Models** module! This module explores how ideas, behaviors, diseases, and innovations spread through social networks and populations. Building on threshold models from our segregation module, we'll examine both biological and social contagion processes using computational modeling approaches.

Contagion models help us understand how things spread - from infectious diseases to social movements, from rumors to technological innovations. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore different mechanisms of transmission, the role of network structure, and intervention strategies for controlling or promoting different types of contagion. We'll see how Granovetter's threshold models {cite}`granovetter1978threshold` provide a foundation for understanding collective behavior and social mobilization.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks
