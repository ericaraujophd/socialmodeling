# SLOs | Contagion

Welcome to the **Contagion Models** module! This module explores how ideas, behaviors, diseases, and innovations spread through social networks and populations. Building on threshold models from our segregation module, we'll examine both biological and social contagion processes using computational modeling approaches.

Contagion models help us understand how things spread - from infectious diseases to social movements, from rumors to technological innovations. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore different mechanisms of transmission, the role of network structure, and intervention strategies for controlling or promoting different types of contagion. We'll see how Granovetter's threshold models {cite}`granovetter1978threshold` provide a foundation for understanding collective behavior and social mobilization.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks

## Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

### Core SLOs

- Construct data-driven, mathematical, statistical, and/or software models, analyzing their results to answer questions, solve problems, support arguments, draw conclusions, make predictions, and/or identify possible causal relationships.
- Identify and use tools appropriate for solving a given problem, such as algebra, calculus, and other mathematical tools; spreadsheets, databases, and data-analysis software; domain-specific software; and/or writing one's own software.

### Conceptual SLOs

- Distinguish between different types of contagion (biological, social, behavioral)
- Explain the role of network structure in contagion processes
- Analyze the dynamics of epidemic curves and tipping points
- Understand concepts like basic reproduction number (R₀) and herd immunity
- Connect threshold models to collective behavior and social movements
- Evaluate how individual thresholds aggregate to produce collective outcomes

### Technical SLOs

- Implement SIR and SEIR epidemiological models in NetLogo
- Model contagion on different network topologies
- Create threshold-based models for collective behavior
- Analyze the effects of intervention strategies on spread dynamics
- Visualize and interpret contagion simulation results

### Critical Thinking

- Evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions
- Assess the parallels and differences between biological and social contagion
- Critique assumptions in contagion models and their real-world applicability
- Analyze the ethical implications of contagion research and policy
- Compare model predictions with real-world contagion phenomena

### Communication

- Present findings from contagion simulation experiments clearly
- Discuss the policy implications of different intervention strategies
- Explain complex contagion concepts to non-technical audiences
- Connect model insights to contemporary public health and social issues

:::{tab-item} Week 5 Reading
**Mark Granovetter (1978)**  
*"Threshold Models of Collective Behavior"*  
American Journal of Sociology, 83(6), 1420-1443.

**Key concepts:**

- Individual thresholds for participation
- Collective outcomes from individual decisions
- Applications to riots, strikes, and social movements
- Mathematical formalization of social influence

**Discussion questions:**

1. How do individual threshold distributions affect collective outcomes?
2. What role does information play in threshold models?
3. Can threshold models explain the unpredictability of social movements?

American Journal of Sociology, 113(3), 702–734.  
[Link to Article](https://doi.org/10.1086/521848)

**Key concepts:**

- Complex contagion vs. simple contagion
- The role of network structure in behavior spread
- Weak ties vs. strong ties in social diffusion
- Experimental validation of contagion theories

**Discussion questions:**

1. How does complex contagion differ from simple contagion?
2. Why might weak ties be less effective for spreading behavior than for spreading information?
3. What are the implications for social movement organization and technology adoption?
