## 📔 Session A (Lecture)

Here are the main topics covered in your "Polarization II" lecture:

1. **Echo Chambers & Network Formation:** How homophily (like-seeks-like) creates clustering that leads to self-reinforcing bubbles with limited cross-group contact
2. **Filter Bubbles & Algorithms:** The synergy between user-driven selective exposure and algorithm-driven personalization that creates parallel information universes
3. **Evidence & Modeling:** Real-world data from Twitter and Facebook paired with agent-based models (ABM) showing how network structure and algorithmic filtering produce polarization
4. **Misinformation Advantage:** Why false news spreads 6× faster than truth, driven by novelty, emotion, and confirmation bias in polarized clusters
5. **The Vicious Cycle:** How echo chambers → misinformation → biased assimilation → hardened attitudes → deepened polarization form a self-reinforcing spiral
6. **Intervention #1: Breaking Echo Chambers:** Cross-cutting communication that works (gradual, civil, credible) versus approaches that backfire (hostile exposure)
7. **Intervention #2: Algorithmic Design:** Platform changes like diversified feeds, downranking extremes, and user control tools that can limit fake news spread
8. **Intervention #3: Inoculation & Trusted Voices:** Prebunking tactics, accuracy nudges, counter-attitudinal validators, and media literacy as resistance-building strategies
9. **NetLogo Modeling Opportunities:** Teaching applications for simulating echo chamber formation, misinformation cascades, and testing interventions
