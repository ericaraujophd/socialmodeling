**Due:** 9/16 before class | **Points:** 100 points

**Prompt (1-2 pages):**

1. Pick one of the toy models shown in our classes over these two weeks (except the Fire model), and perform a single parameter adjustment.
   1. **Setup:** Identify which starter model you used (e.g., Wolf-Sheep, Traffic, Fire).
   2. **Parameters & Code:** Adjust one parameter; note what you changed. If you tried editing code, briefly explain what.
   3. **Results:** Describe what happened compared to the default. Include screenshot(s).
   4. **Interpretation:** What does this show about how simple rules create different outcomes?
2. Write your Lab Memo. You can [download](../resources/lab-memos/Lab_Memo_1_Worksheet.docx) the template in here.
3. Submit your Lab Memo in PDF format through Moodle.

[Here is one example of a Lab Memo](../resources/lab-memos/Lab_Memo_Worksheet_Example.pdf) for the Fire model. Use it as a guide for writing your own lab memos during this course.
