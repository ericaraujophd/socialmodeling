# SLOs | Intro

Welcome to the **Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling & Social Theory** module! This foundational module introduces the intersection of computer science and social science, exploring how computational methods can help us understand human behavior and social phenomena.

This module provides the theoretical and practical foundations for the course. We'll explore what models are, why they're useful in social science research, and how computational approaches can reveal insights about complex social systems. We will also introduce agent-based modeling as a key method for simulating social phenomena.

**Module Duration:** 2 weeks

## Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

By the end of this module, students will be able to accomplish the following SLOs:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Core SLOs

- Introduce students to observational research methods for gathering empirical evidence and to theories that provide analytical frameworks for such evidence.
- Provide students with a sense of the nature and limits of scientific knowledge and the kinds of ethical questions that surround scientific research and its dissemination.
- Study how ideas from mathematical sciences have reflected and shaped other ways of thinking and knowing.
- Define what constitutes a model in social science research
:::
:::{tab-item} Conceptual

- Explain the relationship between social computing and traditional social science methods
